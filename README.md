Hello everybody!

Icehr here. I don't code for a living but I'm very interested in solving everyday enoying problems with code.
I am curious and I want to learn more about Python for a start and a lot of other things after that. The best way to eat a tasty chili con carne is to spread it on the half of a baugette when it has been sitting in the fridge for a day or two.
